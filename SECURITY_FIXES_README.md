# üîí Supabase Security Fixes

This document explains how to resolve the security issues identified by Supabase's database linter regarding `SECURITY DEFINER` views and functions.

## üö® Security Issues Identified

The Supabase linter found 3 critical security issues:

1. **`user_active_ad_removals` view** - Using SECURITY DEFINER bypasses RLS
2. **`recent_leaderboard_entries` view** - Using SECURITY DEFINER bypasses RLS  
3. **`user_statistics_summary` view** - Using SECURITY DEFINER bypasses RLS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Is a Security Risk

`SECURITY DEFINER` views and functions run with the permissions of the view/function creator (usually the database owner) rather than the querying user. This means:

- **Bypasses Row Level Security (RLS)** policies
- **Users can access data they shouldn't** be able to see
- **Potential data leakage** across user boundaries
- **Violates principle of least privilege**

## ‚úÖ How to Fix

### Step 1: Apply the Security Fixes

Run the security fix script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd frontend/game

# Copy the contents of supabase_security_fixes.sql
# and run it in your Supabase SQL editor
```

### Step 2: Verify the Fixes

After applying the fixes, run these verification queries in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check that views no longer use SECURITY DEFINER
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views 
WHERE viewname IN ('user_active_ad_removals', 'recent_leaderboard_entries', 'user_statistics_summary');

-- Check function security settings
SELECT 
    proname as function_name,
    prosecdef as is_security_definer
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN (
    'has_active_ad_removal',
    'get_user_ad_removal_status', 
    'migrate_guest_data_to_user',
    'get_user_leaderboard',
    'get_global_leaderboard',
    'add_leaderboard_entry',
    'initialize_user_statistics'
);
```

### Step 3: Test Your Application

After applying the fixes, test your application to ensure:

1. **Users can only see their own data**
2. **Guest users can access their session data**
3. **Authenticated users can access their historical data**
4. **No unauthorized data access occurs**

## üîß What the Fixes Do

### 1. Views Security Enhancement

**Before (Insecure):**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_active_ad_removals AS
SELECT * FROM user_purchases WHERE product_type = 'ad_removal';
-- This would show ALL users' ad removals to ANY authenticated user
```

**After (Secure):**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_active_ad_removals AS
SELECT * FROM user_purchases 
WHERE product_type = 'ad_removal'
AND (
    auth.uid() = user_id  -- Users can only see their own data
    OR auth.role() = 'service_role'  -- Service role can see all
);
```

### 2. Functions Security Enhancement

**Before (Insecure):**
```sql
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
-- Function runs with creator's permissions, bypassing RLS
```

**After (Secure):**
```sql
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY INVOKER;
-- Function runs with caller's permissions, respecting RLS
```

### 3. Access Control Logic

The fixes implement proper access control:

- **Authenticated users**: Can only access their own data (`auth.uid() = user_id`)
- **Guest users**: Can access data associated with their guest ID
- **Service role**: Has full access for administrative operations
- **Data migration**: Keeps `SECURITY DEFINER` only where necessary for legitimate cross-user operations

## üéØ Security Benefits

After applying these fixes:

‚úÖ **Row Level Security (RLS) is properly enforced**
‚úÖ **Users cannot access other users' data**
‚úÖ **Guest sessions remain isolated**
‚úÖ **Administrative functions still work**
‚úÖ **Data migration functionality preserved**
‚úÖ **Principle of least privilege enforced**

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After applying the fixes, verify:

- [ ] Users can view their own leaderboard entries
- [ ] Users cannot view other users' leaderboard entries
- [ ] Users can view their own statistics
- [ ] Users cannot view other users' statistics
- [ ] Users can check their own ad removal status
- [ ] Users cannot check other users' ad removal status
- [ ] Guest users can access their session data
- [ ] Data migration from guest to authenticated user works
- [ ] Administrative queries work with service role

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Backup your database** (recommended)
2. **Run the security fixes** in Supabase SQL editor
3. **Verify the fixes** using the verification queries
4. **Test your application** thoroughly
5. **Monitor for any issues** in production

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check the Supabase logs for RLS policy violations
2. Verify that your application is properly authenticated
3. Ensure guest IDs are being passed correctly
4. Test with different user accounts to verify isolation

The security fixes maintain full functionality while ensuring proper data isolation and security compliance.
